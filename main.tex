\section{Abstract}

\noindent{This essay is my attempt to pragmatically understand the motivations of piracy, argue against the use of Digital Rights Management (DRM) and refute common stereotypes that are ingrained into the topic. My goal is create discussion, not outrage.}

Piracy has been a topic of fascination since I was a teenager when I discovered BitTorrent around 2009 and I have gathered many different perspectives over the years.\\

%What is piracy
\noindent{}\\

%Piracy as competition
\noindent{Perceiving piracy as a competitive business is my preferred approach to reducing piracy. Understandably it is difficult to compete with a third-party offering a free product, though that doesn't mean that publishers can't consider their approach to content delivery to their paying customers.}\\

\noindent{The best example of this that I know of is the popular digital video game marketplace Steam. Steam is a dominating force in digital distribution on the PC platform (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux). The PC platform is itself an open platform that anyone can create video games for without requiring approval from any single company...}\\

\noindent{Gabe Newell is the founder and CEO of Valve Software who are notable as the developer and publisher of the acclaimed Half-Life and CounterStrike series. His view on piracy is notable when interviewed about Steam's success in the Russia, a country that is known for widespread piracy.}\\

\noindent{\textit{“One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It’s a service issue. The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates. For example, Russia. You say, oh, we’re going to enter Russia, people say, you’re doomed, they’ll pirate everything in Russia. Russia now outside of Germany is our largest continental European market.”}}

%A US dollar has different value around the world - price purchasing parity

%Heavy-handed legal bills SOPA, ACTA, PIPA
\noindent{Legal attempts to further prevent internet copyright infringement outside of the current DMCA have a reputation for being very heavy-handed. There has been a concerted effort for the United States government to propose bills that target websites that host content (such as images, videos and music)}

\noindent{\textit{“...It's the SOPA cabana, it's the SOPA, SOPA can ban ya...”}}
